1. RGB values: this to show how much the red and green and blue for example "rgb (100,200,0)"
2. hex codes: about six hexadecimal that represent the amount of the red and blue and green example  "#ee3e80"
3. colors names: there 147 names the recognized example "red
 
**Contrast: When picking foreground and background colors, it is important to ensure that there is enough contrast for the text to be legible.**
## there are three types of contrast:
***low contrast: Text is harder to read when there is low contrast between background and foreground colors. ***
***medium contrast: For long spans of text, reducing the contrast a little bit improves readability***
*high contrast: Text is easier to read when there is a higher contrast between background and foreground colors.*
