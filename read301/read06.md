## NODE.JS

1. **What is node.js?**
        
    *Node.js® is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome’s V8 JavaScript engine.*

2. **what is Chrome’s V8 JavaScript Engine?**

    *when we say that Node is built on the V8 engine, we don’t mean that Node programs are executed in a browser. They aren’t. Rather, the creator of Node (Ryan Dahl) took the V8 engine and enhanced it with various features, such as a file system API, an HTTP library, and a number of operating system–related utility methods.*   

3. **What does it mean that node is a JavaScript runtime?**
     *it is used to get execute JavaScript on our computers form (https://www.sitepoint.com/an-introduction-to-node-js/)*

4. **What version of node are you running on your machine?**

    *v12.21.0*
5. **What version of npm are you running on your machine?**

    *6.14.11*

6. **What command would you type to install a library/package called ‘jshint’?**

    *npm install -g jshint*

7. **What Is Node.js Used For?**
    
    *These build tools come in all shapes and sizes, and you won’t get far in a modern JavaScript landscape without bumping into them. They can be used for anything from bundling your JavaScript files and dependencies into static assets, to running tests, or automatic code linting and style checking.*

2.  **In your experience, which of these reasons have you found most beneficial?**

    ***Engaged collaboration***


3. **How does pair programming work?**

    ***While there are many different styles, pair programming commonly involves two roles: the Driver and the Navigator. The Driver is the programmer who is typing and the only one whose hands are on the keyboard. Handling the “mechanics” of coding, the Driver manages the text editor, switching files, version control, and—of course writing—code. The Navigator uses their words to guide the Driver but does not provide any direct input to the computer. The Navigator thinks about the big picture, what comes next, how an algorithm might be converted in to code, while scanning for typos or bugs. The Navigator might also utilize their computer as a second screen to look up solutions and documentation, but should not be writing any code.***
