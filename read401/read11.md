## Event Driven Applications


**Why is access control important?**

   *Access control is important because it is a valuable security technique that can be used to regulate who or what can view or use any given resource. ... Without proper access control you could leave your staff and your company wide open to problems such as data loss, theft or breach of privacy and data protection laws.*

**Describe an application that would need access control?**

  *Reistration system for university*

**What is a role used for?**

  *Denied anyone to see data he didn’t need it, that will make the app more secure.*

**Why is role based access control more scalable than discretionary or mandatory access control?**

  - *Because roles can be added easily if needed.*
  - *Actions for each role can be easily modified and will be updated for all users.*
  - *Actions on routes can be changed easily since they are merely parameters in the middleware.*




**Authorization:** ***granting a user to do specific actions***


**Role Based Access Control:** ***is an approach to restricting system access to authorized users. It is used by the majority of enterprises with more than 500 employees, and can implement mandatory access control or discretionary access control.***


**Capabilities:**  ***They are the actions (permissions) specified for each role.***

### Event Driven Programming  


***Event-Driven Programming is a logical pattern that we can choose to confine our programming within to avoid issues of complexity and collision. In this article we’re going to go over how Event-Driven Programming works and how we can make the best use of it in our Node.js projects***

***Most developers are introduced to concepts of Event-Driven Programming early on in their study of programming yet they might not fully realize it until a bit later. You’ll find that the concept is rather ubiquitous. Check any major framework or software out there and odds are you’ll find evidence of Event-Driven Programming.***
