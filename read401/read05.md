## Linked Lists


**A Linked List is a data structure consists of sequence of Nodes that are connected/linked to each other. The most defining feature of a Linked List is that each Node references the next Node in the link.**

**There are three types of Linked List:**

  - **singly linked list**

      - *there is only one reference, and the reference points to the Next node in a linked list.*

  - **doubly linked list**

      - *there is a reference to both the Next and Previous node.*

  - **circular linked list**

      - *there is a reference form the last node to the first.*



**Node:** *the individual iten tha conyaic the data*

**Head:** *reference to the first node*

**Next** *reference to the next node*

**Current:** *reference to the node that is currently being looked at Tail reference to the last node*



***Traversal** **The pseudo-code for an Includes is as so:**

```
ALGORITHM Includes (value)
// INPUT <-- integer value
// OUTPUT <-- boolean

  Current <-- Head

  WHILE Current is not NULL
    IF Current.Value is equal to value
      return TRUE

    Current <-- Current.Next

  return FALSE
```

**Time complexity:** O(n) **Space cpmplexity:** O(1)

**Operations on linked list:**

- **adding a node**
- **delete a node**
- **search a node**
