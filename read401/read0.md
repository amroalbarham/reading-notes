## How to Solve Programming Problems


**A simple set of steps**
*I am going to give you a simple set of steps to follow which you can use for any algorithm type programming problem.*

- ***Read the problem completely twice***

    *This is the single most important step.  You may even want to read the problem 3 or 4 times and You want to make sure you completely understand the problem, A good test of this is whether or not you can explain the problem to someone else.*

- ***Solve the problem manually***

    *Programming is automation plain and simple.  You may have the ability to skip the manual steps and jump directly to code, but there is a manual process which is the foundation of any code you write.*

- ***Optimize the manual solution***

    *People often don’t realize how valuable this step is.  It is much easier to rearrange and reconstruct and idea or algorithm in your head than it is in code.*

- ***Write pseudo-code or comments***

   *Many times you can skip this step if you have a really good handle on the problem or your previous steps already created a detailed enough description of the solution that coding it is already a 1 to 1 translation.*

- ***Replace comments with real code***

    *This step should be extremely easy at this point.  If you have done all the other steps, this step involves no problem solving at all.*


## Pretend Your Time is Worth $1,000/Hour and You’ll Become 100x More Productive


***You have very few hours here on on this earth. Still, many people waste much of their time on pointless, low-quality activities that don’t help them reach their true goals — their mission. The truth is, most people value their time at far, far less than it’s worth. They say yes to things they have no business doing. They give away their talents, attention, and effort to others who take, take, take. They spend hours watching low-quality television and social media when they should be productive and effective. See, many people could be making a fortune (if they used their time well)…but instead, they give away their time in unproductive ways that leave them broke, unhappy.***


## How to think like a programmer — lessons in problem solving

**Why is this important?**

***Unless you have a system, this is probably how you “solve” problems (which is what I did when I started coding) :***

1. Try a solution.
2. If that doesn’t work, try another one.
3. If that doesn’t work, repeat step 2 until you luck out.



## How to Use the 5 Whys

1. **Assemble a Team**

     ***Gather together people who are familiar with the specifics of the problem, and with the process that you're trying to fix. Include someone to act as a facilitator , who can keep the team focused on identifying effective counter-measures.***

2. **Define the Problem**

    ***If you can, observe the problem in action. Discuss it with your team and write a brief, clear problem statement that you all agree on. For example, "Team A isn't meeting its response time targets" or "Software release B resulted in too many rollback failures."***

3. **Ask the First "Why?"**

    ***Asking "Why?" sounds simple, but answering it requires serious thought. Search for answers that are grounded in fact: they must be accounts of things that have actually happened, not guesses at what might have happened.***

4. **Ask "Why?" Four More Times**

    ***For each of the answers that you generated in Step 3, ask four further "whys" in succession. Each time, frame the question in response to the answer you've just recorded.***

5. **Know When to Stop**

    ***You'll know that you've revealed the root cause of the problem when asking "why" produces no more useful responses, and you can go no further. An appropriate counter-measure or process change should then become evident. (As we said earlier, if you're not sure that you've uncovered the real root cause.***
