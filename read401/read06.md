## Authentication


**Explain what a “Singleton” is (in Computer Science terms)?**

***It is a software design pattern that restricts the instantiation of a class to one "single" instance.**

**Explain how the Singleton pattern can be used with Node modules, specifically with classes?**

```
// assume we have a class called logger
class Singleton {
  constructor() {
      if (!Singleton.instance) {
          Singleton.instance = new Logger();
      }
  }
  getInstance() {
      return Singleton.instance;
  }
}
```
**If you were tasked with building a middleware system like Express uses, what approach might you take to construct/operate it?**

***I will write my owm npm package with all middlwares and then deploy it using npm.***

### Terms

- **Router Middleware:** *a middleware that take the original request, and forward it to a sub handler according to the path.*

-  **Dynamic Module Loading:** *it is a mechanism by which a computer program can, at run time, load a library (or other binary) into memory, retrieve the addresses of functions and variables contained in the library, execute those functions or access those variables, and unload the library from memory.*

- **Singleton Pattern:** *It is a software design pattern that restricts the instantiation of a class to one "single" instance.*


**CRUD -> REST** *Method Matches*

**Create-> post**

**read-> get**

**update -> put**

**delete -> delete**


**Mock Testing:** *is an approach to unit testing that lets you make assertions about how the code under test is interacting with other system modules.*

## Bcrypt Hashing Function

**Bcrypt is an adaptive hash function based on the Blowfish symmetric block cipher cryptographic algorithm and introduces a work factor (also known as security factor), which allows you to determine how expensive the hash function will be.**

## basic access authentication

**It is a method for an HTTP user agent (e.g. a web browser) to provide a user name and password when making a request. In basic HTTP authentication, a request contains a header field in the form of Authorization: Basic , where credentials is the Base64 encoding of ID and password joined by a single colon :.**
