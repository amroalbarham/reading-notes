### IMAGES
- *The <'img'>element is used to add images to a web.*
- *You must always specify a src attribute to indicate the source of an image and an alt attribute to describe the content of an image page <img src =”we put the link of img ” alt=”to describe thr content”*
- *You should save images at the size you will be using them on the web page and in the appropriate format.*
- *Photographs are best saved as JPEGs; illustrations or logos that use flat colors are better saved as GIFs.*

### COLOR :
**Color not only brings your site to life, but also helps convey the mood and evokes reactions.**
*we add color to specify a color to text inside elements by :*
- **rgb values : p { color: rgb(250,200,0);}**
- **hex codes:  h3 { color: #ff3e80;}**
- **color names: h1 { color: red;}**

### Opacity(rgba)

- **CSS3 introduces the opacity property which allows you to specify the opacity of an element and any of its child elements. The value is a number between 0.0 and 1.0 (so a value of 0.5 is 50% opacity and 0.15 is 15% opacity)**
- **CSS3 also allows you to specify colors as HSL values, with an optional opacity value. It is known as HSLA.**


### TEXT
- *There are properties to control the choice of font, size, weight, style, and spacing.* 
- *There is a limited choice of fonts that you can assume most people will have installed.*
- *If you want to use a wider range of typefaces there are several options, but you need to have the right license to use them.* 
- *You can control the space between lines of text, individual letters, and words. Text can also be aligned to the left, right, center, or justified. It can also be indented.* 
- *You can use pseudo-classes to change the style of an element when a user hovers over or clicks on text, or when they have visited a link.*
