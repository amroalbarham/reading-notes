## basic javascript instructions:
+ A script is made up of a series of statements. Each
statement is like a step in a recipe.
+ Scripts contain very precise instructions. For example,
you might specify that a value must be remembered
before creating a calculation using that value.
+ Variables are used to temporarily store pieces of
information used in the script.
+ Arrays are special types of variables that store more
than one piece of related information.
+ JavaScript distinguishes between numbers (0-9),
strings (text), and Boolean values (true or false).
+ Expressions evaluate into a single value.
+ Expressions rely on operators to calculate a value
 
## HTML 
### we can divide the mark up to two parts :
* **Structural markup:** the elements that you can use to 
describe both headings and paragraphs
* **Semantic markup:** which provides extra information; such 
as where emphasis is placed in a sentence, that something 
you have written is a quotation (and who said it), the 
meaning of acronyms, and so on 
#### there are a lot of tags like <p> for paragraph and <b> for **bold** and <i> for *italic* and <br  /> to find line break and <hr /> to creats break between themes.
