## Table :
 **A table represents information in a grid format**
 

+ **<'table>':the<'table'> is used to create a table. The contents of the table are written out row by row.**
+ **<'tr'>: You indicate the start of each row using the opening <'tr'>tag. The tr stands for table row.**
+ **<'td'>: You indicate the start of each row using the opening <'tr'>tag. The tr stands for table row.**
+ **<'th'>:The <'th'> element is used just like the <'td'> element but its purpose is to represent the heading for either a column or a row.**
+ **<'thead'>:The headings of the table should sit inside the <'thead'> element.**
+ **<'tbody'>:The body should sit inside the <'tbody'> element.**
+ **<'tfoot'>:The footer belongs inside the <'tfoot'> element.**


**Domain modeling is the process of creating a conceptual model for a specific problem. And a domain model that's articulated well can verify and validate your understanding of that problem.**

***Here's some tips to follow when building your own domain models.***

- *When modeling a single entity that'll have many instances, build self-contained objects with the same attributes and behaviors.*
- *Model its attributes with a constructor function that defines and initializes properties.*
- *Model its behaviors with small methods that focus on doing one job well.*
- *Create instances using the new keyword followed by a call to a constructor function.*
- *Store the newly created object in a variable so you can access its properties and methods from outside.*
- *Use the this variable within methods so you can access the object's properties and methods from inside.*
